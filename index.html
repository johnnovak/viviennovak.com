      <p>Have you ever taken a look to see where thoughts arise from? The
      everyday belief is that they are coming from me, I am thinking them. But
      what do you do in order to think? How do you birth a thought into
      existence?</p>

      <p>Thinking that one knows the answer is not the same as discovering it
      in first-hand experience. So have a look. Is thinking your doing? Are
      you the thinker? Or are you just noticing thoughts as they pass by?</p>

      <p>And where do thoughts appear? In a mind, which is inside the head? Is
      this assumption in line with experience, how it actually is? If you look
      very closely, you can discover that just because thoughts arise, it does
      not follow that they appear in a mind, and certainly not in the
      head.</p>

      <p>And what about consciousness or awareness? Is there a conscious
      awareness sitting in your head peeking out through the eyes, like two
      windows? &mdash; Knowing or “aware-ing” is the very fabric of experience. How
      could it exist in the head?</p>

      <p>What is a self? Isn’t the self about oppositions? &mdash; What it takes
      itself to be is in opposition to what it does not take itself to be. Me
      and not-me. Inside is me, outside is not me. But where is the dividing
      line between me and not me?</p>

      <p>Can the seeming division between me and not me be softened? Can you
      notice that you actually do not see a dividing line anywhere in
      experience? Isn’t me and not me only an artificial division of
      experience? Like cutting off a small piece of existence and call it as
      “me”, and labelling the rest as the “outside world” from which I have to
      defend myself.</p>

      <p>This border between me and not-me is usually believed to be the skin,
      where the body ends. Everything inside the skin is me, and everything
      outside of it is not me. And since thoughts seem to appear in the head,
      they are also inside of me.</p>

      <p>But are you the body? Or are you <em>in</em> the body? Or rather you
      <em>have</em>
      a body? Where is this self or “I” that thoughts are constantly referring
      to? Is there an actual “I” residing in the head? Have a look. Is there
      anything else to the head than sensations? Is there someone
      <em>inside</em> the
      body? &mdash; If you put aside all assumptions and theories and look what is
      here and now, you can discover that the “me” is a myth; it’s just an
      imagination, a fictional character that “lives” only in the story-land
      of “my life”.</p>

      <p>But is life happening <em>to</em> me, or <em>as</em> a thought story
      <em>about</em> a “me”? Is experience happening <em>to</em> the body, or
      <em>as</em> the body? Isn’t the body showing up as experience itself
      (including the head), as the experience of sensations?</p>

      <p>We seem to live life at face value, and we rarely (if at all) look
      behind the surface. We simply take our core beliefs as facts of reality.
      But if we put our beliefs under the microscope, then we can discover
      that our thoughts and beliefs simply cannot stand up to the scrutiny of
      our immediate experience.</p>

      <p>The artificially constructed self-concept boils down to the belief
      that there is a subject to experience, who is somehow outside of what is
      happening, distanced and apart from what IS. But we can discover that
      experience does not belong to a separate self who experiences. There is
      nothing outside of experience to have an experience.</p>

      <p>These virtual divisions can show up in many ways. We often say that
      “I was lost in thought”. But is that really possible, or it just seems
      that way? Is there something standing apart from the totality of the
      here-and-now experience, and somehow being dragged into thoughts?</p>

      <p>Just notice that it is always now. There might be thoughts about the
      past and the future, but when do these thoughts appear? In the past and
      the future? Or everything that ever happens can only happen here-now?
      When you are thinking about the past, do you believe that you left this
      moment, and you are in the past? It certainly can feel that way, but is
      that so?</p>

      <p>We’ve all heard the phrase: “Just stay present. Just stay in the
      now.” But is the present moment something to abide in? Something you
      often leave, but you come back to it to rest there?  Can you fall out
      from this moment? Can you be anywhere else but here, now? Are you apart
      from this present moment experience? &mdash; It is simply impossible. We never
      leave the present moment experience, since it is the only thing there
      is. Thus we can never be apart from it.</p>

      <p>Simply put: you are not what you think you are. The person you have
      taken yourself to be has never been, except as a thought. Nothing exist
      separate from you.</p>

      <p>The only thing standing in the way of clear seeing is your false
      ideas about who you are.</p>

      <p>When you really look, you can discover that these
      words are pointing to something so simple, something so obvious, that when it
      is looked at and seen, you wonder how it was ever missed.</p>

        <p>Some days ago now, there was a thought of “So is this it? Just
        this?” And a nodding of the head &mdash; “Yep, this is it. Just this”.
        Laughter. Love. Huge gratitude.</p>

        <p>It’s very, very cool.</p>

        <p>More than anything I’d like to say thank you for your guidance and
        patience. Reinforcing the importance of actual experience encouraged
        me to keep coming back to looking at what was actually happening, and
        not letting "thought" try to take over (again!). Invaluable!</p>

        <p>It feels freeing to see this. There is a great sense of relief.
        Thank you Vivien for sharing your time with me, I am so grateful!</p>

        <p>After having seen through the illusion, there is a sense of
        curiosity and an aliveness that “I” never thought possible before
        realizing that there is no “self”.</p>

        <p>In love and gratitude,<br>Marie</p>

        <p>It feels very free! There is no “I” to criticise or berate. It’s
        pointless. Before, there was a pretty definite “I” looking to “get
        somewhere” with this inquiry. Now it feels there is nowhere to get to
        or achieve. Who would achieve it? Haha… it’s like a big cosmic joke.
        Experimenting with direct experience through the senses has been
        illuminating. It became very clear how mental concepts in the shape of
        images mainly distort the actual experience and give “meaning” to it.
        The labelling is endless and not stoppable, but to SEE that is what is
        happening all the time has been an eye opener. So nothing has really
        changed in a funny way; everything is still the same. It’s just the
        way everything is now perceived that is different. As if a film with
        stories has been made transparent. The stories are still there; but it
        is clear that they are just that: stories. Mental concepts. Not what
        is really being experienced.</p>

        <p>It’s very relaxing. It creates space in which there is more to laugh
        about!</p>

        grateful for the opportunity to work with you, and to receive your

        <p>It is freeing, and as if a light has been turned on.</p>

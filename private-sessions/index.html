      <h2 id="private-sessions" class="sepa-before">Private sessions</h2>

      <p>I offer two types of one-on-one private sessions: inquiry into the
      self, and inquiry into emotions (which sometimes overlap).</p>


      <h3>Inquiry into the self</h3>

      <p>This inquiry is for you if…</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You have an intellectual understanding of there being no separate
          self, but you don’t know how to see it for yourself as a first-hand
          experience</li>

        <li>You are longing for awakening and want to realize what it means
          that “you are not who you think you are”</li>

        <li>You have already had glimpses, but you feel that something is
          holding you back from the experiential recognition of what you know
          to be true</li>

        <li>You often find yourself thinking about the past and imagining the
          future, instead of noticing the ever changing present moment
          experience as it is</li>

        <li>You would like to discover what beliefs you hold that create the
          feeling of being separate from life</li>

        <li>You can see that you are not the body-mind, yet you don’t know who
          or what you are</li>

        <li>You feel you are stuck in the witness position</li>

        <li>You have had experiences of there being no real inherent me/ego,
          but this recognition has been gradually fading, and now it is mainly
          just a memory</li>

        <li>You are tired of being a long-time seeker, and for once and for
          all you want to stop seeking by finding what you have been searching
          for</li>

        <li>You have had the realization of the absence of a separate self,
          yet the sense of separation still persists</li>

        <li>You feel ripe and ready to finally put aside all books and videos,
          and do an inquiry of your own experience, so you can finally live
          the recognition of there being no inherent separate me/self</li>

        <li>You have gathered a plethora of expectations how awaking should be
          like, and you suspect that your expectations might be in the way of
          seeing things clearly in this moment as they actually are</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you would like to have several sessions at certain intervals, then
      I can give you exercises and pointers &mdash; based on our conversation
      &mdash; to investigate on your own between sessions.</p>

      <p>If you would like to have a taste of the inquiry into the self, please read
      the <a href="/">home page</a>.</p>


      <h3 class="sepa">Inquiry into emotions</h3>

      <p>This inquiry is for you if…</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You have already recognized that there is no real inherent
          me/self, and yet you don’t feel free because of certain patterns and
          emotions repeatedly coming up and blocking you from being at
        ease</li>

        <li>You would like to release deep rooted beliefs you hold about
          yourself &mdash; like “I am not good enough” or “I am not lovable”</li>

        <li>You would like to discover what beliefs you hold that create
          suffering in your life</li>

        <li>You are on the path of awakening, but you have some addictions
          &mdash; like cigarette, food, spending too much time on social media
          &mdash; that you would like to finally let go of</li>

        <li>You would like to decondition and unlearn old patterns of feeling
          that don’t serve you anymore</li>

        <li>You feel ready to face your fears and see them in a different
          light</li>

        <li>You would like to live freely from regrets of the past, or
          feelings of guilt and shame</li>

        <li>You would like to perceive your emotions differently, without the
          need to run away from them</li>

        <li>You are already on the path of awakening, yet you often worry
          about the future and you don’t know how to stop worrying and live in
          peace</li>

        <li>You are seeking freedom from the incessant stream of stressful
          thoughts</li>

        <li>You have realized that no matter what you do, you are always
          dissatisfied in one way or another</li>

        <li>You often feel resistance or aversion to certain things or people
          in your life</li>

        <li>In spite of all your efforts on being on the right path, you don’t
          know how to forgive yourself or other people </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Please make sure to read the <a href="#disclaimer">Disclaimer</a>
      before booking a session.</p>


      <h3 class="sepa">How to prepare for the session</h3>

      <p>Each session is 75 minutes long.</p>

      <p>For the time of our session, find a place where you can be alone and
      won’t be disturbed at least for an hour and a half. It’s
      also best to keep some tissues at hand, just in case :)</p>


      <h3 class="sepa">Booking sessions</h3>

      <p>I live in Brisbane Australia (UTC+10), so we have to find a time that
      suits both of us.</p>

      <p>Here is a link to a good time converter. If you add your location,
      you can see how your time converts to my time:</p>

      <a href="https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/">https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/</a>

      <p>For me, between <strong>10am to 5pm Brisbane time</strong> is best.</p>

      <p>Please use the <a href="#contact">contact form</a> below if you would
      like to book a session.</p>

      <p>Please write a few sentences of your present situation that you would
      like to investigate. Make sure to include the <strong>country and
      city</strong> where you live, <strong>your name</strong>, and your
      <strong>Skype user name</strong>.</p>


      <h3 id="fees" class="sepa">Fees</h3>

      <p>Each session is 75 minutes long.</p>

      <p>Currently, I have no fixed fees, but I ask for a donation. The
      average amount people usually give is around <strong>$100-150 (USD)</strong>.

      The minimum amount of donation is $100.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Please make sure that you send your donation <strong>48 hours
            prior</strong> to the scheduled session time, or your booking may
          be cancelled without notice.</li>

        <li>Cancellation of scheduled appointments must be made <strong>at least 36 hours
            prior</strong> to the session. Fees may be incurred otherwise.</li>
      </ul>


      <h4>Please respect my time</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>If you do not show up for your session without <em>any</em> prior
          notice, I cannot refund your donation.</li>

        <li>If you show up late, the session will still end at the scheduled
          time (so your session will be cut short).</li>
      </ul>

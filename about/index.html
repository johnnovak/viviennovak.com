      <p>Have you ever taken a look to see where thoughts arise from? The
      everyday belief is that they are coming from me, I am thinking them. But
      what do you do in order to think? How do you birth a thought into
      existence?</p>

      <p>Thinking that <em>one knows</em> the answer is not the same as discovering it
      in first-hand experience. So have a look. Is thinking your doing? Are
      you the thinker? Or are you just noticing thoughts as they pass by?</p>

      <p>And where do <a href="">thoughts appear</a>? In a mind, which is
      inside the head? Is this assumption in line with experience, how it
      actually is? If you look very closely, you can discover that just
      because thoughts arise, it does not follow that they appear in a mind,
      and certainly not in the head.</p>

      <p>And what about <a href="#">consciousness</a> or <a href="#">awareness</a>?
      Is there a conscious awareness sitting in your head peeking out through
      the eyes, like two windows? – Knowing or ‘aware-ing’ is the very fabric
      of experience. How could it exist in the head?</p>

      <p>What is a self? Isn’t the self about oppositions? – What it takes
      itself to be is in opposition to what it does not take itself to be. Me
      and not-me. Inside is me, outside is not me. But where is the dividing
      line between me and not me?</p>

      <p>Can the seeming division between me and not me be softened? Can you
      notice that you actually do not see a dividing line anywhere in
      experience? Isn’t me and not me only an artificial division of
      experience? Like cutting out a small piece of existence and call it as
      ‘me’, and dooming the rest as the outside world from which I have to
      defend myself.</p>

      <p>This border between me and not-me usually believed to be the skin,
      where the body ends. Everything inside the skin is me, and everything
      outside is not me. And since thoughts seem to appear in the head, they
      are also inside me.</p>

      <p>But are you the body? Or are you in the body? Or rather you have
      a body? Where is this self or I that thoughts are constantly referring
      to? Is there an actual I residing in the head? Have a look. Is there
      anything else to the head than sensations? Is there someone inside the
      body? – If you put aside all assumptions and theories and look what is
      here and now, you can discover that the ‘me’ is a myth; it’s just an
      imagination, a fictional character that ‘lives’ only in the story-land
      of ‘my life’.</p>

      <p>But is life happening to me or as a thought story of me? Is
      experience happening to the body, or as the body? Isn’t the body showing
      up as experience itself (including the head), as the experience of
      sensations?</p>

      <p>We seem to live life at face value, and we rarely (if at all) look
      behind the surface. We simply take our core beliefs as facts of reality.
      But if we put our beliefs under the microscope then we can discover that
      our thoughts and beliefs simply cannot stand up to the scrutiny of our
      immediate experience.</p>

      <p>The artificially constricted self-concept boils down to the belief
      that there is a subject to experience, who is somehow outside of what
      is, distanced and apart from what IS.  But we can discover that
      experience does not belong to a separate self who experiences. There is
      nothing outside of experience to have an experience.</p>

      <p>These virtual divisions can show up in many ways. We often say that
      ‘I was lost in thought’. But is that really possible, or it just seems
      that way? Is there something standing apart from the totality of the
      here-and-now experience of thinking, and somehow being dragged into
      thoughts?</p>

      <p>Just notice that it is always now. There might be thoughts about the
      past and the future, but when do these thoughts appear? In the past and
      the future? Or everything that ever happens can only happen here-now?
      When you are thinking about the past, do you believe that you left this
      moment, and you are in the past? It certainly can feel that way, but is
      that so?</p>

      <p>We’ve all heard the phrase: “Just stay present. Just stay in the
      now.” But is the present moment something to abide in? Something you
      often leave, but you come back to it to rest there?  Can you fall out
      from this moment? Can you be anywhere else but here, now? Are you apart
      from this present moment experience? – It is simply impossible. We never
      leave the present moment experience, since it is the only thing there
      is. And we can never be apart from it.</p>

      <p>Simply put: you are not what you think you are. The person you have
      taken yourself to be has never been, except as a thought. Nothing exist
      separate from you.</p>

      <p>The only thing standing in the way of clear seeing is your false
      ideas about who you are.</p>

      <p class="sepa more-space">These words are pointing to something so simple, something so
      obvious, that when it is looked at and seen, you wonder how it was ever
      missed.</p>

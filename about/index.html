      <p>My search probably started in my late teenage years. I’ve always been
      fascinated by both the human psyche and the functioning of the physical
      body. Especially how the human mind works, why we behave in the way we
      do, why it’s so difficult to change our habits, why we feel what we
      feel, and why we have so little control (if any) over our emotions.</p>

      <p>I had a difficult childhood, which resulted in some painful coping
      mechanisms, and since my teenage years I was constantly searching for
      ways to change myself. This search largely contributed to obtaining
      a degree in psychology. So I spent almost a decade trying to heal my
      wounded little girl inside with all sorts of psychological methods. This
      period was very useful, but it couldn’t penetrate deep enough, to the
      essence of human dissatisfaction and suffering, since it was all about
      a self, who needed to be different in order to participate in life with
      less dissatisfaction, pain and fear.</p>

      <p>I was around 30 and I was in a shopping mall when suddenly I woke up
      from the incessant stream of thoughts, and got very aware that behind
      (or under) all that thinking, there was a full living world of
      experiencing. Sounds, colors, shapes, all sensations, everything was in
      constant flux. These were all there all along, but I could never really
      notice them before, since I was so immersed in the internal
      conversations; replaying past events and fantasizing about how I could
      have replied or behaved differently; and planning and fantasizing about
      future scenarios where I was different, like a better version of
      myself.</p>

      <p>This was a fleeting realization, but it left a deep recognition that
      there is a different way to live than constantly being immersed in the
      artificial thinking-world.</p>

      <p>A few years later, I was a full-time seeker. One day, I was binge
      watching various teachers on  YouTube, and the notion of  there being no
      free will really caught my attention. I found the idea very fascinating.
      I stopped the video for a short bathroom break, but I couldn’t stop
      thinking about it. So I decided that I was going to check if this was
      really true, to see it for myself if any actions or movements were my own
      doing, or they happened without any control. And what I saw was
      shocking. Everything happened automatically. I was so astonished that
      I leaned back against the wall and was unable to move for several
      minutes. I was standing there in utter shock and amazement as if I were
      thunderstruck.</p>

      <p>Some days later, after waking up, still in bed, I decided that for
      once and for all, I was going to find the me the word “I” was pointing
      to. I slowly repeated the word “I” again and again, and watched with
      curiosity to see what this word was pointing to.  And every time I said
      the word, it felt as if it was pointing to my chest. But when I looked,
      there was no I, no me inside the chest, only sensations. So I kept
      repeating the word “I” and looked everywhere this word could possibly
      point to. But I found nothing, except the thought of “I” itself. And the
      more I looked, the clearer it became that this word had no roots in
      reality. It was just a thought and nothing else. All I ever believed
      myself to be was just a thought. Just a word; a single letter. This
      discovery was much gentler and softer, with a hint of smile on my face
      and relaxation of the body.</p>

      <p>In most of my life, I perceived myself like an empty glass, and
      I needed others (especially the loved ones) to fill this glass with
      love, but not just to fill it, but constantly re-fill it; since at the
      bottom of the glass there was a hole, and the contents were gradually
      seeping away. Now, there is no empty glass anymore, there is no glass at
      all. I simply stopped demanding love in my close relationships, since
      there is no lack of love anymore.</p>

      <p>But I don’t want to give the impression that seeing through the
      self-illusion will eradicate all patterns and conditionings, all at
      once. My empty glass dissolved not simply because the illusionary nature
      of the “me” had been realized, but because the lots of additional
      emotional work I had been doing both before and after the realization.
      And I am not implying either that there are no more conditionings and
      patterns to dissolve. The cleaning up can last some time. But
      investigating emotions is usually easier after seeing through the “me”
      or “ego”.</p>

      <p class="sepa-after more-space">Over the years, I have been working
      one-on-one with people from all parts of the world on the Liberation
      Unleashed forum, and successfully guided a great deal of them to see
      that the “me” or “ego” is not a real, self-directed, enduring,
      independent entity. It is just a figment of our imagination, which is
      supported by the thought-story of “my life”, and certain bodily
      sensations which are being misperceived to be the physical location of
      this fictional me-character.</p>

        <p>Clear, precise, direct, persistent, consistent, brilliant. These
        are the words I would use to describe Vivien’s guidance. There is
        a freedom that comes with realizing truth of who we are, and Vivien is
        masterful at guiding one to that truth.</p>

        <p>After her skilled guidance, I felt a release for the need for
        constant self-improvement, the impulse to constantly look toward the
        future for something “better”; a better me, better circumstances,
        better job performance, better relationships… I didn’t realize it at
        the time, but this fantasy of something and someone better, which was
        always “over there”, was very stressful! I feel much less attachment
        to this way of thinking, and much less attachment to my thoughts in
        general. This has led to a more peaceful experience with not only
        thoughts that arise, but also my emotions. There is more of
        a curiosity and openness; a sense of acceptance of exactly what is
        exactly the way it is.</p>

        <p>I have a deep gratitude for Vivien in leading the way for me and
        changing my life in such a simple, brilliant, clear and direct
        way.</p>

        <p>Having gone through this inquiry has been the most liberating and
        spiritually meaningful thing in my life. With the help of Vivien’s
        dedicated and no-nonsense guidance a new world of acceptance and
        freedom has opened up in which there is just pure, direct living. It’s
        right in front of your nose, all you have to do is look!</p>

      <figure class="testimonial">
        <p>I consider myself truly fortunate for having Vivien guide me
        through the “Gateless Gate”.  I find Vivien’s guiding to be highly
        effective, straightforward and to the point. Her depth of seeing, and
        experience in guiding many people through the gate puts her in
        a unique position to immediately realize where her clients are stuck,
        and her pointers are often delivered with surgical precision. For
        people who appreciate clear and effective guidance, I know no better
        choice than Vivien.  </p>

        <p>I devoted most of my life to accumulating knowledge with the intent
        of finding out what is real, what is true, and the meaning of my
        apparent existence.  My many years of searching have been futile;
        I used the wrong set of tools and was blindly stumbling in the dark.
        With Vivien’s guidance, the realization was indeed shocking, it felt
        like a cosmic joke has been unveiled, the most (if not the only)
        important thing there is to realize, and yet, at the same time,
        perhaps the simplest and most obvious truth to see.  Wouldn’t you want
        to know without a shadow of a doubt?</p>

        <p>Each person will have a unique realization, but for me the
        compulsive search has ended, the heaviness and urgent gravity of life
        has been replaced with a sense of flow and acceptance, thoughts and
        emotions are experienced but don’t take over, and the simplest things
        can reveal their beauty once again. </p>

        <p>Vivien was a great guide to me, firm but gentle. There is a big
        wisdom in her, how she guides you through your own shadows, blocks and
        blind spots. She was like a candle light, always when I thought
        I can’t see, I don’t know which direction to go, she was there, to
        light my way, to take the next step. I judge her also very patient and
        warm-hearted, I could trust her from the beginning. </p>

      <figure class="testimonial">
        <p>Having Vivien as a guide was an absolute dream. Her patience
        combined with her direct no BS approach was the perfect combination
        for truth realization.</p>

        <p>Having spent years seeking via reading spiritual books, taking
        spiritual courses, watching spiritual videos, meditating, finding
        Vivien and her guiding was an absolute life changer.</p>

        <p>Before finding Vivien I was an intense seeker, now I simply dwell
        in being here and now. It’s truly beautiful.</p>

        <p>Before, emotions would always linger around for a long time,
        especially the unpleasant ones. Now, they are simply seen and pass by
        like clouds. It’s been so liberating to realize the illusion of
        self.</p>

        <p>Thank You, Vivien! You are incredible.</p>

        <p>Going through the inquiry process with Vivien’s guidance was
        intense, illuminating, and fundamentally changed my perspective on
        myself and the world, letting life and light shine through in the end.
        She’s a patient guide who was very creative, sensitive, and also
        relentless in keeping me honest over many weeks of daily inquiries!
        I’m so grateful for her generous and committed help on this path.
        Vivien totally blew my mind :)</p>

      <figure class="testimonial">
        <p>When I found Vivien I was thrilled, I felt like the end of seeking
        was in sight. She came through with such crystal clarity, which did
        not seem to be muddled with any “self” or agenda in there. I am
        thrilled she was willing to guide me.</p>

        <p>She dances with the inquiry/guiding with total clarity and
        precision. She was the gentle vajra master I was looking for. Vivien
        pointed out areas of confusion or assumption of which I was not aware.
        Emotions and feelings were broken down and ultimately seen through
        with her diligent pointing from several different angles.</p>

        <p>With the help of Vivien’s guiding the façade of false perceptions,
        of false notions of a separate solid self began dissolving. And what
        was and is left then is the fresh empty aliveness that was here the
        whole time… this true Self discovering Itself becomes the cause of
        great fun, celebration and laughter. If you have found yourself able
        to work with Vivien, I would say that is an auspicious thing
        indeed!</p>

        <p>Vivien was a thoughtful, thorough, and insightful guide for me
        during a particularly challenging phase in my life. With the tools she
        taught me (and the care she expressed in the way she taught them),
        I was able to gain a new level of freedom, acceptance, and stability
        in regard to the emotional storms I was navigating, and came out the
        other side having grown considerably, both emotionally and
        spiritually.</p>

      <figure class="testimonial">
        <p>A year ago, by the recommendation of a friend, I found Vivien. Upon
        her guidance, with simple pointings and very direct questions it took
        around 3 weeks to start looking and not thinking and just to see the
        simple fact of reality that there never was a me, a Luchana, some
        separate entity with life and goals. What a great joke! This subtle
        realization came so suddenly that I just couldn’t stop laughing for
        days.</p>

        <p>Vivien kept me alert and help me focus on the inquiry, until
        actually nothing more was left, but just looking. Her seeing is so
        clear and direct that it was almost impossible for me not to see.</p>

        <p>After couple of months or almost a year, when the seeing started to
        settle down, I asked Viven to be my mentor when I started to make the
        first steps as a guide. And she is absolutely amazing not only as
        a guide, but as a mentor as well. Her pointing and questions put
        a light in every dark corner and wash away any doubts when such arise.
        Life is being lived freely, much more lightly, so much joyfully.
        I feel immense gratitude towards Vivien, towards life itself and
        I just accept this gift as an absolute miracle.</p>

      <figure class="testimonial">
        <p>Vivien is a brilliant guide, not only instantly spotting the blocks
        to clear seeing in what was written, but also in what was not,
        prompting her to put another very pertinent set of questions to me.
        Thus leading to the seeing of no-self very quickly. It is early days
        for “Peter” but deep changes are already apparent in ways I could not
        have foreseen prior to the seeing. I am very grateful for her
        guidance.</p>

      <figure class="testimonial">
        <p>I love images as they always seem to contain more than the words
        can. When I got in contact with Vivien, I was on a very stormy sea,
        tossed and blown about by beliefs, teachings, thoughts… and there,
        in the distance, was this bright lighthouse, turning and flashing
        a light to me. Steady, calm, persistent… all the while allowing me
        all the freedom to find my way to shore or not. That was Vivien.</p>

        <p>I could not see that it was the beliefs, teachings, thoughts that
        were the stormy weather and sea and that there was no boat, no “one”
        lost at sea. This guiding that Vivien did was tantamount to teaching
        the blind that they are blind. Made all the more paradoxical by the
        discipline of seeing… looking. Amazing and simple all at the same
        time.</p>

        <p>Looking showed me that there’s no one here making decisions. This
        intense looking inside for that “someone” who decides found no one
        there. One minute this body does one thing and the next moment it does
        something else but the looking did not show any “one” there doing the
        change. So who is this “I” that is talked about?</p>

        <p>Probably the most intense understanding came from how much I used
        beliefs as knowledge. I walked and talked about things like I had
        actually looked and lived it. Living in the mind is a tangled web of
        self-deception if it is not looked at. And how I resisted what I was
        seeing because it did not match up with these untested beliefs!</p>

        <p>I cannot recommend Vivien’s help and guidance enough. Those gentle
        shakes on the shoulder to wake “me” from slumber was epic.</p>

        <p>I was very fortunate to have Vivien as my guide in the process of
        recognising no self. Her deep experience and firm insightful
        questioning soon found where “I” was stuck. She then provided exactly
        the right pointers and materials to get me unstuck. Once this is seen,
        it cannot be unseen and I now see things very differently than before
        and will be eternally grateful to Vivien for her skill in guiding me
        to that seeing.</p>

        <p>Last year I had the good fortune to be guided by Vivien in the area
        of non-duality. Through her very patient and committed approach, she
        helped me gain insights along the path that I had been seeking to
        understand for years. I am hugely grateful to her for pointing me
        towards really “seeing” these truths in a profound and lasting way. In
        the best of ways… I’ll never be quite the same again. Thank you
        Vivien.</p>

        <p>I was fortunate enough to have had Vivien guide me to seeing the
        truth. Her clarity, insistence and purpose kept me on track and
        focused, to the point that the truth was known.</p>

        <p>Since then the manner in which I experience life has radically
        transformed. The shift has provided something akin to a more objective
        perspective when confronted with the natural movement of emotion.
        A feeling of lightening and space is apparent.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for holding my hand and walking me through this
        tentative time.</p>

        coming next. She is very patient, clear and concise in her guiding and
        will not give up on you till you get it right and she is sure that you
        have seen through the illusion. Thank you!</p>

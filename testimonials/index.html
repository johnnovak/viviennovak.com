        <p>An unexpected gift from Ilona! That hour and a half of communion
        opened up immeasurable depths in me. I was a little confused, and Ilona
        very easily, joyfully and simply brought me back to myself. It was an
        indescribable feeling of being at ease, deep emotion and strong insights
        that brought me to the state of noticing the here and now.</p>

        <p class="last">It felt like inner freedom opened up and unleashed itself from
        desire to define myself, to fit into description, to limit myself to
        the truths and rules of others. There is such freedom in my heart to
        feel abundance and completeness, freedom to feel everything. There is
        a recognition that everything is already given and we experience life
        as it is through ourselves and others.  Thank you, Ilona. I am so
        grateful we met.</p>

        <p>After ten years of shadow work and inquiry, I thought I was pretty
        much ‘done.’ Ha! Your clarity, realness, and rigor had me see truth,
        and for that I’m eternally grateful.</p>
